m THE arasa ORATION

7 lawa, went in an ille lmsnner, and without any public authority,
into an assembly of e peopla,who were then electin Gracchus
tribune a second time, attached him and lris friends, an put him to
daath-Pontifex mucimus.- Ιι is the opinion ol many that Cicero
here appliss to Scipio the title Pontifex Maximus, by anticipation,
as he immediatel asterwards calls him simply a prisca person3 but
as the Pontifex aximus was not, properly speaking, amcgistmte,
tha term priam is rightly applied ιο hun in contrast with memes

· in the sama sentence. ·

ὅ. Servilius Aleta: ln the elath year oi* Rome, there was aiamine
in tha city, by means of which, Livy says, a private man was near ’
obtaining possession of spvereign power. Minucius was appointed
bytho senate and people to procare corn in the adjacent countries, i
but met with little success. Spurius Melius, the richest private man
in tha commonwealth, had bought up so muchof it iathe neigh-
boring provinces, that the agent of the ublic could not purchase
provisions efthat kind. The corn, which elius had purchased, was
'berally distributed among tha people, and so great was the popu·
larity he acquired by this artifice and munificence, that a conspiracy
was formed to change the form ¹of government3 Melius aspired ιο
royalty3 the pao le were to take anns in his favor, and the tribunes
consentodlto seli the public liberty. Upon the discovery of the

, conspiracy, Τ. Q. Cincinnatus was appointed dictator, who, anp-
pcsing that nothing but a stroke of authority could destroy so dan·
geraus a plot, immediately sent Servilius Ahala, his master of the

orso, to cite Melius to appear before his tribunal. Melius, surprisad,
endeavored to make his escape; Servilius commanded a lictor ιο
arrest him. Melius, imploria the assistance oi' the pcople, was
rescusd by the multitude, eni again endeavored to escape ; but
Servilius, pursuing him, overtook him, ran him through the body with
his sword, and thus preserved the libertics oi his country-Nacta
rebus audemem: “ Plotti a revolution.''

¹ which was common in those meetings, Q. Antillius, one of his lictors,
was killed. O imius excited the senators to executa immediate
vengeance on racchus and Fulvius Flaecris, who were supposed ιο
be the authors of the lictor's death, but a violent shower of rain
obliged the parties to separate. On the ¹nent day, Gracchus and
Fulvius with their friends were assembled on Mount Aventine; the
Sancte conferred unlimited power on Opimius, the consul imme-
diately attacked the partisans of Gracchus, and slew Fulvius, his
sens, and three thousand of his followsrs. Gracchus sought shelter
