most important consist of the Synopticnl end Analytical Tables ol' Vo-
ellus. These were first publirhad by Olivet, and, it is believed, have
neverbeen repnblished, probably on account of the difficulty of reducing
them‘to the siae of a school book. They were originally intended for
the help of young students, and the school-bey recollectione of many
persons will doubtless convince them ol' the necessity of some such aid
for-understanding the structure and scope of these most artificial com·
positione, and for perceiving the relation of each loeson to the general
argument of which it forms a, part. As the Tables conciet almost el· .
ways of the precise words of the text, only differently disposed, they
do not render less necessary to the student a thorough investigationi of
the words of his lesson; end while they encourage diligence, they will

not scrsen idlencss. In these, also, care hasbeen taken to conform ¹

the orthography to that'of the body of the Oratione, and to adapt to the ’
sectiorn in common use the numbers bywhich Voellus referred to the
now disuaeddivisions of Nizolins.
