31. agnarum pedihus.- Phidippus had been in tbe service of Dei· 79
otsnrs's de oties, and perhaps m no more honorable a capacity
thau that 0le footrnan.

9. Sed tud rapientia fitoequtesimum: sufficient has already baeu 80
ssid concoming Cicero¹s datter of Caesar.

11. Nemo memfsrd est, eta: his observation is just, end Cicero
deserves oreditfor suggesting it ιο caeser. When a man is both
Jud eand party in an accusation, there is great probability, thet he
willbe more favorable to himself thau ιο the accused.

³4. Qui pro mades sepe dixisti .· ln a note to a former oration (page
⁷7,1ine d), we have already observed, that Cesar, in the early part of
his life, applied himself to the business of the bar.

38. De accusotomam spe: ,Ther the student may be able to judge
· more impartially of the character of Deiotarus and his accusers, we
will quote an observation of e J'udioious commentator. ‘⁴ As to the
‘facts laid down iu this oration. we cun say very little ; but, by what
we understand from 'our author himself in other parts of his writings,
the charges are not so destitute of probability and proof, as he would·
represent thern. With regard to the characters, the one given of Del· ⁸
clarus, throughout this oration, l am apt to believe, is very much inis-
represented; for, by all oth'er accounts, he appears to have been a
monster of blood and cruelty; since he put to death all his own
children, and alterwards Castor's own father, which may well ac·
count for Castor's appearing in tbe prosecution.¹’

19: ss...-.eacamaaa datis usus met: lt is related that ‘Cesar told 81
Deiotarus, “ You are a very old niun, Pompey ts not to expect, that
{tert {r tttttt⁰¹⁶att⁶fttt teter-'³3¹- 'tt‘ ⁸⁰ bretti
theirghdad ᾖ and that' eiotnrbs was syo inveterdte'au lsbdmy to Cre·
scr, ‘3¹th he wonrd not urge even old age as an excuse for not taking
the e .

2⁴. Errorscommant aare est: Cicero here artfull apologizes for
Deiotarus without offen ing Caesar, by peying metridate of flattery,
which in a fow lines follows, end by appeariug to believe the plausi-
ble excuses Caesar bad formed ιο Justify his usurpatione.

2. In quera elem oa· rupere homines, etc. .· “Envy and emulation conse 82
with the life of the person envied and rivalled. Αιι ambitibus mun,
therefore,¹ will hear without being offended the praises bestowed upon
e deceased enemy, which, hed the enemy been living, would have Ι
induced him to inflict upon tho panegyrist the dictatas of the soverest
vangeahce. The encomiums Cicero he're pronounces upon Pompey
were, without doubt, rather pleastng then offenstve to Caeeer3 the
moret Pompey was extollet, the more merit the conqueror os Poru-

23. Alexandrinum bellam: Ailer the battle of Pharsalia, Oaesar im·
mediately set sail for Egypt, to which country Pompey had fled aster
his defeat. Upon his landing, the first news ho received informed
him of Pompey‘s miserable end. He wept, when he heard the sc·
eountand shortly after ordered a magnificent tomb to be built to
bis memor . Atthis time there were two pretenders to the crown
of Egypt, l'tolemy, the aoknowledged kin , und the celebrated Cle·
opatra, his sister. Caesar ordered both ol them to maintain, their
protensione before him. Photinus, the young king's guardian, dis-
da'nred accepting this proposal, and sent an crrny of twenty drou-
