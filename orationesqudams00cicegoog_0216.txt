62 9. Dinarni silentii: ln a letter to Servius Sulffioius, proconsul in
Graece, Cicero, mentionin the petitine for arcellus’s return,
writes, ¹‘ What the senate did was tlris; upon the mention of Mar·
celius by Piso, his brother Gaius having thrown himself at Caesar'a
feet, they all rose up, and went in a supplicating manner towards

as soon aa l was called upon, changed my mind ; for l had resolved

hitherto avoided giving offense, (and, i liae always continued silent,

he would have interpreted it perhaps as a proos of my helieving tha
repuhlro to be turned) Ι shall spealr for the future not often, or rather
