THE ORATION FOR THE Pom* ARCHIAS.

*—

muaouucmort.

'l'nrs elegant oration was delivered in tha fflssnd year of Rome, two
years aflet the consulship of Cicero, and one year aller the defeat of
Catilina and his accomplices. ln early life Cicero had been placed
under the tuition of Aulus Licinius Archias, a native of Antioch,
and a man patronised by men of the greatest emineres in Rome for
his learning, genius, and politaness. llis celebrity was so great,
that Lucullus 1nvited him to reside in his family, and ve him tha
prIvilege of opening a school in it, to which many of t e oung Ro·
mannobility were senttobeeducated. The prosperityo this popu·
lar poet and instructor, however, was interruptad by tha malignity
of an obscure person, of the name of Gracchus, or by the subornatiou
of those who persuaded him to acts of enmity against Archias. Syl·

vanus and Carbo had passed a law, which anacted, that those should ·

be esteemed Roman citizens, who were admitted to the fraedom of
lany (ff tgre pionfplderated 1office, who, at ²¹¹⁰.²¹¹¹¹d⁰ ofthe passing oftlae

M. P. Piso aad M·.V' hleslsala, Gracchus accused Archias; he said
that Archias lrved in the city ae a citizen, while he was not entitlad
to the rights of citizenship. He denied that Archias was admitted
to the freedom of any of the confederated cities, that he had an abods

in Italy at thc time the law was passed, and that he had claimed the ·

privileges of a citizen before the pretor. ln this oration, which was
delivered before the praetor, Cicero defends Archias, his friend and
former instructor: he refutes the alle tiens of Gracchus, and proves
that Archias was admitted to the aedom of Heraclea and other
cities, thet he dwelt in ltaly attha time of the passing of the law,
and that he claimed his privileges before tha proewr. The orator,
however, does not confine himse f to the defence of Archias, but, with
great heaut and elegauce,descants upon the praises of try iu
general, an upon the talents and merit of the defendant. ceordic
to Dr. Middleton, Cicero “expected for his paine an immortality of
fame from the praises of Arcluas's muse; but, by a contrary fate of
things, instead of deriving any addition of lory from Archias's com·
ositions, it is wholly owing to his own, at the neme of Archias
iias not long ago been buriad in oblivion. from the great character
given by him of the talento and genius of this poet, we cannot help

sorry-suth year23f his age.
