42. Νι legar-etan A. Gabinius: Itis said by Roman historiens, that 57
the only motiva, which induced Gabinius ιο publish his law in favor
of Pompey, was the desire of being cheren one of his lieutanants.
Pompey solicited this, but the people refused it ; and, although Cicero
hera says. that this refusal appeared to him a great indignity, wa
must doubt concaming hia sincerity, since, in another oration (Post
Reditum in Senatu), he sa a, that Gabinius was ιο necessitous and ιο
profligate at thia time, that, if he had not passed this law, he must
have turned pirate, himself.

plhese circumstances, it was customary to adrance the tribunes to the
'eatanancies

16. Proeter intercessionum: It was in the power of any tribuna to
stop the proceadings of any asaembly of the eople by his rntercession,
that ia, by prcnouncing the solemn word eto.

19. Unus A. Gabinius....omnea Cn. Pompeio: lt has been said, we
must not believe Cicero sincere in all the opinions he adranaea in
his orations, he was so much ef a statesman and lawyer, as some-
times, for a politic purpose, or a client's advantage, to express a belief

, which he did not entertain. See Note,page 5⁷,1in0 42, and the last
, note tothisoration.

42. Senum...nari0: Cicero here apologiaas for the unusual aa·
thority conferred on Pompey, by the exemplos of Scipio and Marius.
Scipio AEmilianus was twice elected consu at an illegal age, and in
his consulships destroyed Carthago in Africa, and Numantia in Spain.
Marius was elected seven times consul, which electione were un·
precedented. Ha conquered J ugurtha, the Cimbri, and the Teu-
tanes.

9. Α ιιιιιιοιίο gradu atas lon ὲ abtum It is said b Dr. Alexan· 59
der Adam, that in tha time of Sicera, the usual aga ofbein chosen
a senator seems to have been thirty-one; of Pompey, Plutarcfi relatas,
that he could have bean received into the sanate before that age, but
that ha refused it; his vain-glory induced him to think it a greater
honor to triumph, while he was only knight.

14. fliampltare: Itis related, that when Pompey had defeated
Domitius AEnobarbua and Ηίιιιιιι, king of one part cf Numidia, and
returned to Rome, he demanded a triumph of Sulla, at that time dic-
tator. Baing refused, he said it would be beat for Sulla to consider,

“ that tha rising had more worshippers than the settingeun.” Sulla ‚
did not hear thia; but being told of it, he was struck with tha bold·
ness ofhthe expression, and instantly said, “ Lat him triumph, let him
trium .’'

29. pltea-am.- Pompey had a second triumph, for hia victory orer the
ramainsof Sertoriua’sarm .

10. Serviliae.- Alter the defeat of the prator Antonius, P. Servilius 61
was sent against the pirates. Having defeated thern, taken many of
their citios, and subdued the natien of the Isauri, ha acquired atri·
