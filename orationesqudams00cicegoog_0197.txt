ἸἮΕ ORATION FOR THE MANILIAN LAW.

manutenent.

Ture celebrated oration, the first which Cicero delivered from the
Rostra, was pronounoed in the berth year of Rome, in the tlet ear
of tbe orathr’s age, and three years before the orations against ati-
line. The Romans at that time were nn aged in war with Mithri·
dates, lri of Pontus. This monareb, abia, ambitione, warlike, and
a second annibal in military talenta, as well as in hatred ιο the Ro·
mane, disdained to submitto the commanda of the Roman commis·
sioners in Asia, whioh oheoked his enterprieee‚ and, in oool blood,
ordered eight thousand Roman citizens to be maeraored in one day.
Sulla, and, er him, Lucullus had been sent against thie owenul
prinae 3 but, though they repeatedly defeated him, they h not en·
tirel subdued him. The revalence and op reesivo administration
oi eMarian fection in Kome obliged the ormer general to make
peace with Mithridates, and give him an opportunity to retrieve bis
affairs, and make more vigorous opposition ιιι future. Lucullus prob·
ably would bave subjugated him, bad not a mutiny in the Roman
army existed, and bad not the eneral'e persona} enemies in Rome
persuaded the renate ιο recall im. These unfortunate incidente
anabled Mithridates to become master of the field; the Romen army
was dissipated; the Roman eneral was removed; Glabrio, the oon·
sul, who was sent to sueoeetf Lucullus, was a man of inferior talenta. ·
At thir time, Manilius, one oi' tbe tribunes, proposed a law, that
Pompey, who was then in Cilicia terminating the piratio war, should
have the government of Aria added ιο his commiseron, with tbe oom-
mand of the Mithridatia war, and of all the Roman arntiee in those

rte. This law was much op osed by the senate, who were unwil-
bbg to confer so extensive eutherii upon any individual, but was eo

aooeptable to the peoyle, of whom ἔσαιρε] was a great favorite, tbat

nonebutCatulue an Hortensius, who had both aeeed through the
consulship, dared to epeak against it. lt was iahadan by Serviliae
leanrieue and eene Cicero also, at that time praetor, most eloquent·
ly advocated it in thie oration.
